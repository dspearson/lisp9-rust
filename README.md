LISP9 in Rust
=============

I don't know [LISP9](http://www.t3x.org/lisp9/index.html), and I don't know [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). So, what did I decide to do? Implement a language interpreter for a language I don't know in a language I don't know.

I have not yet decided whether this is sane or insane, but it seems like a good exercise to me. I'll get to refresh my C too, since that's what the original interpreter was written in.

(I'm currently leaning more towards _insane_.)
